SockJS-node Connection Example
==============================

To run this example, first install dependencies:

    npm install sockjs
    npm install faye-websocket
    npm install node-static
    npm install node-uuid
    npm install util

And run a server:

    node server.js

That will spawn an http server at http://127.0.0.1:9999/ which will
serve both html (served from the current directory) and also SockJS
server (under the [/connect](http://127.0.0.1:9999/connect) path).
